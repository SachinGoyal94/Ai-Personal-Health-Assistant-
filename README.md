## 🧠 What's Inside?

Explore the major components of this AI system, each focused on delivering intelligent, user-centered functionality:

- **Sleep and Activity Prediction:**  
  Predicts quality of sleep and recommends personalized tips for improvement using lifestyle data.

- **Disease Prediction System:**  
  Uses symptom-based inputs to predict potential diseases through trained ML models.

- **Nutrition & Health Recommendations:**  
  Provides diet suggestions based on health conditions and goals.

- **Doctor Finder:**  
  Returns nearby doctors based on user’s location input.

- **Text Rephraser & Image Generator (WIP):**  
  Additional modules under development using Generative AI (text-to-image and NLP-powered rephraser).
